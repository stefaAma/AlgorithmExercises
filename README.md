# Algorithms Exercises
Knowing algorithms and data structures is a fundamental skill for a computer scientist, so I decided to load the exercises already done with the idea of going to face increasingly complex problems. The programming language chosen is Python, due to its versatility.

## Current categorization
* backtracking
* data_structures
* dynamic_programming
* pattern_problems
* searching_problems
* sorting_problems

### Attention

Even if most of the algorithms are sorted correctly in their category, some should be moved, and I should also create a more accurate categorization.
